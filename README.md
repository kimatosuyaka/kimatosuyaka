### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ - My name is Luis Silva

I am a specialist in industrial process control, in other words: Automation and Industrial Control.
But I am a lover of everything that has to do with programming, I especially like Javascript and its immense, or infinite? ecosystem, I don't know if life will be enough to know everything.
